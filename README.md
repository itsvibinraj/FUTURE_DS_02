📊 Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker
Project Type: Data Analytics Internship Task 2 Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI, Excel, DAX Dataset: [Facebook Ads Performance Data (Kaggle)]

📖 Project Overview
This project is an interactive analytics dashboard designed to track and evaluate the performance of social media ad campaigns. The goal was to analyze raw marketing data to identify top-performing ads, understand audience demographics, and optimize Return on Investment (ROI).

The dashboard answers key business questions such as:

Which campaigns are generating the highest ROI?

Who is our most engaged demographic?

Where are we wasting budget?

⚙️ Key Metrics & KPI's
The dashboard tracks the following custom metrics calculated using DAX:

CTR (Click-Through Rate): Measures ad engagement efficiency.

Cost Per Conversion: The cost to acquire a single customer/sale.

ROI (Return on Investment): Calculated based on an estimated Average Order Value (AOV) of $100.

Impressions vs. Spend: Trend analysis to monitor daily ad performance.

🖼️ Dashboard Features
Executive KPI Banner: Immediate view of Total Spend, Impressions, CTR, and ROI.

Audience Demographics: A clustered bar chart breaking down performance by Age Group and Gender.

Performance Trends: A time-series line chart tracking Reach and Spend over the campaign duration.

Ad Deep-Dive: A detailed table ranking specific Campaign IDs by ROI and efficiency.

💡 Key Insights & Recommendations
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following actionable insights were derived:

Top Performer: Campaign 916 is the most efficient, achieving a massive 1503% ROI with a low Cost Per Conversion of $6.24.

Target Audience: Females aged 30-34 show the highest engagement and reach. Future budgets should prioritize this demographic.

Cost Efficiency: While Campaign 1178 has high reach, it is expensive ($43.85 per conversion). Reallocating budget from Campaign 1178 to Campaign 916 is recommended to maximize profits.
